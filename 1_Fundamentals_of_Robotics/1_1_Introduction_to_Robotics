# What is Robotics and Robots?
- Robotics is a field of science working with machines that perform tasks based on predetermined and adaptive programs and algorithms in an automatic or semi-automatic way.These machines – commonly called robots – are either controlled by humans or work entirely under the supervision of a computer application and algorithms. Robotics is a comprehensive concept that includes the building, planning and programming of robots. These robots are in direct contact with the physical world – and they have often been used to perform monotonous and repetitive tasks instead of human beings. Robotics is the intersection of science, engineering and technology that produces machines called robots that substitute or replicate human actions. Robotics is the study and development of the theory, design, construction, operation and application of autonomous agents that can perceive their environment and react to it.Robotics involves understanding how a system works, such as its components or how it interacts with other systems. These include sensors that measure environmental conditions and computing systems that process information from those sensors.
